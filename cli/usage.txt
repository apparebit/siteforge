> site:forge (<option> | <task>)*

The site:forge static website generator supports the following <b>tasks</b>:

  build                      Build the website
  validate                   Validate the website
  deploy                     Deploy the website


It also supports the following <b>task-independent options</b>:

  -V, --version              Print tool version, exit before running tasks
  -h, --help                 Print tool help, exit before running tasks
  -v, --verbose              Increase the volume by one level
  -q, --quiet                Decrease the volume by one level

  --json                     Log in newline-separated JSON format
                             instead of (colorful) plain text.

  --realm <label>            `development` or `production`

If the only command line argument is "-v", "-vh", or "-hv", site:forge treats
the "-v" as an "-V" on assumption that printing the tool version is more helpful
than increasing the volume when not generating output besides maybe this help.

The default volume is 0. At that level, the output of error(), warning(), and
notice() is visible, though info() and debug() are suppressed.


The <b>build task options</b> are:

  --content-dir <path>       Read content from directory ("./content")
  --component-dir <path>     Read components whose specifier is prefixed with
                             dollar character from directory ("./components")
  --build-dir <path>         Write build to directory ("./build")
  --clean-build              Delete previous build instead of overwriting files
  --do-not-build <glob>      Exclude matching files from build
  --copyright <notice>       Prepend copyright notice to scripts and styles
  --static-assets <glob>     Treat JavaScript files as static assets, not as
                             views ("**/asset/**|**/assets/**|**/static/**")
  --version-assets           Version scripts and styles by injecting a hash of
                             that content into the filename.

Unlike most static website generators, site:forge does not do "layouts". Instead
it takes a cue from React.js and features "page providers":

  --page-provider <spec>     Use page provider ("$layout/page.js") — a module
                             specifier starting with `$` indicates a shared
                             component, here "./components/layout/page.js".


The <b>validate task options</b> are:

  --do-not-validate <glob>   Exclude matching files from validation


The <b>deploy task options</b> are:

  --build-dir <path>         Read build from directory ("./build")
  --deployment-dir <remote>  Deploy build to rsync host and directory
  --dry-run                  Run rsync without actually making changes


site:forge respects the following <b>environment variables</b>:

  NO_COLOR                  If defined, log without color.
  NODE_DISABLE_COLORS       If defined, log without color.
