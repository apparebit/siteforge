> site:forge <option>* <task>*

The site:forge static website generator can perform the following <b>tasks</b>:

  build                      Build the website
  validate                   Validate the website
  deploy                     Deploy the website


The following <b>options</b> further control task execution. If a project
follows the naming conventions documented below, the use of options should be
mostly unnecessary.

                                  <b>Help</b>

  -V, --version              Display tool version, exit before running tasks
  -h, --help                 Display tool help, exit before running tasks

If either help option is specified, site:forge ignores tasks and other options.

                             <b>Console Output</b>

  -v, --verbose              Increase the volume by one level
  -q, --quiet                Decrease the volume by one level
  --json                     Format output in newline-separated JSON
                             instead of (colorful) plain text.

If the only command line argument is "-v", "-vh", or "-hv", site:forge treats
the "-v" as an "-V" on assumption that printing the tool version is more helpful
than increasing the volume when not generating output besides maybe this help.

The default volume is 0. At that level, the output of error(), warning(), and
notice() is visible, though info() and debug() are suppressed.

                         <b>Directories and Files</b>

  --content-dir <path>       Read content from directory ("./content")
  --component-dir <path>     Read components from directory ("./components")
                             before falling back on builtin module loader
  --page-provider <spec>     Use component for page layout ("layout/page.js")
  --build-dir <path>         Write build to directory ("./build")
  --deployment-dir <remote>  Copy build to rsync host and directory

                             <b>Exclusions</b>

  --do-not-build <glob>      Exclude matching files from build
  --do-not-validate <glob>   Exclude matching files from validation

  --clean-run                Delete previous build instead of overwriting files
  --dry-run                  Run rsync without actually making changes

                              <b>Content</b>

  --static-assets <glob>     Treat JavaScript files as static assets, not as
                             views ("**/asset/**|**/assets/**|**/static/**")
  --version-assets           Version scripts and styles by injecting a hash of
                             that content into the filename.
  --copyright <notice>       Prepend copyright notice to scripts and styles


In addition to the above options, site:forge respects the following
<b>environment variables</b>:

  NO_COLOR                  If defined, log without color.
  NODE_DISABLE_COLORS       If defined, log without color.
