 * from paths for HTML documents with that name and the extensions `.htm` and
 * `.html` from the paths for all other HTML documents. Furthermore, it removes
 * the trailing slash from all paths. Trailing slashes only make paths more
 * complex without adding expressivity to the web. Unfortunately, in the absence
 * of index file and trailing slash, browsers resolve relative URLs off the
 * parent directory and not the page itself. Though that is simple enough to
 * overcome with tooling that rewrites relative to absolute URLs. Thankfully,
 * the practice of using `.htm` as a file extension for HTML documents seems to
 * be largely confined to Windows users. That is not surprising, given that
 * three letters were a historical MS-DOS limit. But it also is more reason for

/**
 * Walk the file system tree rooted at the given directory. The walk may include
 * resources more than once if the file system supports hard links. The walk may
 * also include resources outside the tree if the file system supports symbolic
 * links. This function does protect against getting stuck in a cycle, e.g.,
 * when a symbolic link points to one of its ancestral directories, by tracking
 * the [real path](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realpath.3.html) of the
 * file system entities visited so far.
 *
 * When invoked with just a directory argument, this function does very little,
 * i.e., performs no I/O. For an actual walk to happen, it requires meaningful
 * `handleNext` and `handleFile` callbacks that schedule the corresponding
 * asynchronous operations. With @grr/multitasker's `handleWalk()` method that
 * becomes as easy as:
 *
 * ```js
 * walk(root, { isExcluded, ...multitasker.handleWalk(handleFile) });
 * ```
 *
 * Nonetheless, the default implementation for both handlers is a noop, since
 * doing otherwise would have created a hard dependency on that package. The
 * `handleNext` callback schedules the next unit of work and is invoked as:
 *
 * ```js
 * handleNext(handler, path, virtualPath);
 * ```
 *
 * The work is performed by executing `handler(path, virtualPath)`. The
 * `handleFile` callback actually processes a file and is invoked as:
 *
 * ```js
 * handleFile(path, virtualPath);
 * ```
 *
 * Both callbacks are expected to return a promise that only resolves when the
 * work has actually been performed. The `handler` passed to `handleNext` does
 * observe this contract.
 *
 * As the handlers illustrate, this function identifies each file system entity
 * by _two_ paths. The first is the real path, which is also used to protect
 * against cycles in the walk. The second is the virtual path, which takes
 * symbolic links at name value. For example, when `a/b/link` is a symbolic link
 * to directory `c/d`, the first, real path is `c/d` and the second, virtual
 * path is `/a/b/link`. If file `c/d/file` is visited next, then the first, real
 * path is `c/d/file` and the second, virtual path is `/a/b/link/file`. To
 * ensure predictable results, this function processes directory entries sorted
 * by their UTF-16 code points. Otherwise, a directory with a file `file` and a
 * symbolic link `link` to that same file would either yield `file` or `link`
 * depending on which order `readdir` happens to return entries.
