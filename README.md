# site:forge

site:forge is a static website generator.

 1. It __dispenses with niche languages__, including for templating and styling,
    and instead __standardizes on JavaScript__ for all application logic.
 2. It __supports proactive view components__ for conveniently and flexibly
    assembling content from smaller building blocks. Since they only need to
    be rendered once, way ahead of time, they also are much simpler than those
    in React.js and similar frameworks. In fact, they are little more than
    __functions implementing the same signature__.
 3. It is written in __modern JavaScript__ and fully embraces asynchronous code
    as well as ECMAScript modules. It also is composed from several __packages
    designed for interoperability__. Changes that reduce hard dependencies and
    improve extensibility are forthcoming.
