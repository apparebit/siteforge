# @grr/multitasker

This package enables concurrent execution of more than one asynchronous task.
Since it also enforces an upper concurrency limit, tasks are queued. In fact,
they may be placed into one of three queues in @grr/multitasker, the regular
_ready_ queue, a high priority _asap_ queue, and a low priority _blocked_ queue.
Tasks in the first two queues are automatically scheduled when runtime capacity
allows, but tasks in the third queue require user intervention again.

## The Multitasker Class

The documentation covers useful constants, how to create multitasker instances
and adapt to other APIs, how to inspect state and be notified of state changes,
and last but certainly not least, how to control task execution. Basic use of
this class is straight-forward:

```js
// Import Multitasker.
import Multitasker from '@grr/multitasker';

// Create an instance.
const multitasker = new Multitasker();

// Repeatedly enqueue asynchronous tasks,
// i.e., functions and their arguments.
multitasker.enqueue(fn, ...args);

// Wait until all tasks have completed.
await multitasker.onidle();

// Or, terminate prematurely.
await multitasker.stop();
```


### Constants

Tasks may be enqueued with high and low priority by providing the corresponding
constant as the first argument to `enqueue()`. At any given time, a multitasker
is in one of four states.

#### Multitasker.Asap

Increase priority for a task.

#### Multitasker.Block

Decrease priority for a task.

#### Multitasker.Idle

The idle state: The instance is not executing any tasks but can start at any
time.

#### Multitasker.Running

The running state: The instance is executing tasks.

#### Multitasker.Stopping

The stopping state: The instance is shutting down, therefore not accepting new
tasks but allowing running tasks to complete.

#### Multitasker.Done

The done state; The instance has shut down and will not run again.


### Creating Multitaskers, Adapting to Other APIs

#### Multitasker({ concurrency = 8, context = {} } = {})

Create a new multitasker with the given maximum concurrency and context object.
The context object is the `this` receiver for task execution. If it does not
have a `multitasker` property, this multitasker is patched into the context
under that name.

#### Multitasker.prototype.handleWalk(handleFile)

Adapt this multitasker to do the scheduling for a file system walk with the
given file handler. This method returns on object with suitable `handleNext`
and `handleFile` properties.


### Polling State, Signalling Changed State

The state of a multitasker can be queried with the `is()`, `hasTaskReady()`, and
`hasCapacity()` methods and applications can be notified of state changes with
the `onidle()`, `onstop()`, and `ondone()` methods. Use callbacks for
infrequent, unpredictable events and polling for frequently occurring events.

#### Multitasker.prototype.is(...statuses)

Determine whether this multitasker is in one of the given states.

#### Multitasker.prototype.hasTaskReady()

Determine whether this multitasker has at least one task ready for execution.

#### Multitasker.prototype.hasCapacity()

Determine whether this multitasker has at least one slot open for execution.

#### Multitasker.prototype.onidle(fn?)

Chain the callback to a promise that fulfills when this multitasker reaches the
idle state again and return the resulting promise. If no callback is provided,
this method returns the former promise, thus facilitating the following idiom:

```js
await multitasker.onidle();
```

#### Multitasker.prototype.onstop(fn?)

Chain the callback to a promise that fulfills when the `stop()` method is first
invoked on this multitasker and return the resulting promise. If no callback is
provided, this method returns the former promise, thus facilitating the
following idiom:

```js
await multitasker.onstop();
```

#### Multitasker.prototype.ondone(fn?)

Chain the callback to a promise that fulfills when this multitasker has shut
down and return the resulting promise. If no callback is provided, this method
returns the former promise, thus facilitating the following idiom:

```js
await multitasker.ondone();
```


### Tasks Execution

The public API only has three more methods, all of which control task execution.

#### Multitasker.prototype.enqueue(priority?, fn, ...args)

Enqueue the task function and its arguments for execution, optionally with high
or low priority. Tasks with high priority execute before all others, even if
that means temporarily starting regular task execution. Tasks with low priority
are effectively blocked. The result is a promise that will settle with the
result of the task. The `this` receiver for task execution is this multitasker's
`context` (see constructor above).

#### Multitasker.prototype.unblock()

Release all low priority tasks for execution by moving them to the ready queue.
To correctly implement task blocking, this method should not be invoked while
regular or high priority tasks are still executing, i.e., this multitasker is
not yet idle again. While easy enough to enforce mechanically, this method does
_not_ do so, since draining ready queues only to fill them again has a
significant performance impact. Having said that, if an application truly
requires blocking semantics, it must wait for the multitasker to become idle
before unblocking:

```js
await multitasker.onidle();
multitasker.unblock();
```

#### Multitasker.prototype.stop()

Terminate the multitasker. After this method has been invoked, no new tasks will
be scheduled and a best effort attempt will be made at terminating on-going
tasks early. This method returns a promise that fulfills when this multitasker
has stopped. That means stopping a multitasker and waiting for it to be done
is as simple as:

```js
await multitasker.stop();
```
