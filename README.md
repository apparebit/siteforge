# site:forge

site:forge is a static website generator.

 1. It __dispenses with niche languages__, including for templating and styling,
    and instead __standardizes on JavaScript__ for all application logic.
 2. It __supports proactive view components__ for conveniently and flexibly
    assembling content from smaller building blocks. Since they only need to
    be rendered once, way ahead of time, they also are much simpler than those
    in React.js and similar frameworks. In fact, they are little more than
    __functions implementing the same signature__.
 3. It is written in __modern JavaScript__ and fully embraces asynchronous code
    and ECMAScript modules. It has __few external dependencies__ and instead
    relies on a number of packages co-developed with site:forge. These packages
    are __designed for interoperability with limited interdependency__. They
    also are well-tested, with almost all packages having 100% test coverage or
    being close to it.
