> site:forge (<option> | <task>)*

Run this static website generator. It supports the following tasks:

  build                      Build the website.
  validate                   Validate the website.
  deploy                     Deploy the website.


It supports the following task-independent options:

  -V, --version              Print tool version, exit before running tasks
  -h, --help                 Print tool help, exit before running tasks
  -v, --verbose              Increase the volume by one level
  -q, --quiet                Decrease the volume by one level

  --json                     Log in newline-separated JSON format
                             instead of (colorful) plain text.

  --realm <label>            `development` or `production`

If the only argument is "-v", "-vh", or "-hv", site:forge treats the "-v"
as a "-V".


The following options apply to the build task:

  --content-dir <path>       Read content from directory ("./content")
  --include-dir <path>       Read shared content from directory ("./include")
  --build-dir <path>         Write build to directory ("./build")
  --clean-build              Delete previous build instead of overwriting files
  --do-not-build <glob>      Exclude matching files from build
  --rights-notice <notice>   Prepend rights notice to scripts and styles
  --version-assets           Version scripts and styles by injecting a hash of
                             that content into the filename.


The following options apply to the validate task:

  --do-not-validate <glob>   Exclude matching files from validation


The following options apply to the deploy task:

  --build-dir <path>         Read build from directory (default: "./build)
  --deployment-dir <remote>  Deploy build to rsync host and directory
  --dry-run                  Run rsync without actually making changes

The default volume is 0. At that level, the output of error(), warning(), and
notice() is visible, though info() and debug() are suppressed.

site:forge recognizes the following environment variables:

  NO_COLOR                  If defined, log without color.
  NODE_DISABLE_COLORS       If defined, log without color.
