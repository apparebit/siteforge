Fundamentally, any templating system makes it possible to splice the results of
evaluating expressions in between verbatim text. Coincidentally, that also holds
for JavaScript's builtin template strings. However, since those template strings
are JavaScript source code, they cannot be stored in separate files. This
package fixes that by making it possible to turn arbitrary text into templates.
